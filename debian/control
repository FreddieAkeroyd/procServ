Description: Process server with telnet console and log access
 procServ is a wrapper that starts an arbitrary command as a child process in
 the background, connecting its standard input and output to a TCP port for
 telnet access. It supports logging, child restart (manual or automatic on
 exit), and more.
 .
 procServ does not have the rich feature set of the screen utility,
 but is intended to provide running a command in a system service style,
 in a small, robust way.
 Handling multiple users, authorization, authentication, central logging
 is done best on a higher level, using a package like conserver.
 .
 For security reasons, procServ only accepts connections from localhost.
