R1-4 3/9/2006
Fixed double characters when the other user is typing.
More informational messages: PIDs for everything, when sigchild and sigpipe happen and more
info at sign-on.
Put in better detection and reporting in case the startup file is not usable.  Procserve will try
to print an informational message and die.

R1-3 3/2/2006
Added the logfile feature - if stdout is a file we leave it open and write messages to it.
Added better startup handling
Added start and restart time messages.
R1-0 9/11/2003
This is the first real version that works as desired.  I have added since 1.1 several
features.

The option of running as a daemon controlled by the environment variable "PROCSERV_DEBUG".

Tuned the informational printfs.

Added some interaction with telnet protocol, enough that linemode in the telnet client is
disabled. The whole telnet state machine is more complex than it needs to be but I think that
I can use it later.  There is room for adding features here.


Known problems:
I don't have the CR-LF handling from the user just right.  One of the debugging functions in
the sequencer does something incompatible and the user has to send ^j s instead of cr to get
the next line.

Users monitoring see characters flowing both ways, double echos.  The fix for this is to
have SendToAll be a litte smarter.

1.1 9/2/2003
This works.  Telnet comes up in linemode meaning that characters are echoed and held by telnet
until it gets a <CR>. The whole line is then sent.  If you type a control character you must type
<CR> to get it sent. If the control character is ^C then you get hosed.
